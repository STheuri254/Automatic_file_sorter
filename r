## Automatic File Sorter in File Explorer
This project is an Automatic File Sorter built with Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It organizes files in a specified directory by automatically moving them into categorized folders based on file type (e.g., documents, images, videos). This tool helps keep directories tidy and makes file management easier.
## Features
Automatic Sorting: Detects files in a specified directory and sorts them into subfolders based on file extension (e.g., .pdf, .jpg, .mp4).
Customizable: Allows users to specify the directory to sort and configure file type categories.
Efficiency: Reduces time spent organizing files manually, especially useful for directories with mixed content.
